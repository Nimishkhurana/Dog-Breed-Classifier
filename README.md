# Dog-Breed-Classifier
It is a flask web app wrapping a ui around pytorch models to predict the breed of dog. <br>
I compared two models VGG16 and Densenet121.<br>
Weights are not uploaded but the notebook of training models is there and you can replicate the same results.<br>
I trained only the classifier part and got 87% percent accuracy.One can get more accuracy by finetuning the complete model.<br>

VGG16 is correct in this.
